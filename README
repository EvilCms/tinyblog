/**TEMPLATES**/
Tools you can use in templates:
%title%,%desc%,%blog-% (- indicates extra param)
You can add your own in @ global.php
$template->SetParam('<param-name>', <data to be shown>);

When writing your templates, you must follow these rules:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="framework/tpl/<name of theme>/css/style.css"/>
This is a very primitive system, updating soon.
Templates do not need to have any opening <html> tags
If you have about.php in your theme, create an about.php file in your root.
Code:
<?php

require_once('global.php');
$template->Write("about");
?>

/**PLUGINS**/
When writing a plugin, please conform to the iPlugins interface. Plugins need to be in the form of classes. (Will be changed)
This version is not for live use, it is a developers version.
